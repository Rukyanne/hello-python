##  Project Description

This is my first Python project—a foundational exercise in programming. It's a simple script that demonstrates how to output text to the console using Python's `print()` function. The goal of this project was to understand basic Python syntax, learn version control with Git and GitHub, and establish good documentation practices.

---

##  What This Program Does

This "Hello World" program serves several important purposes:

1. **Environment Testing:** Verifies that Python is correctly installed and configured on your system
2. **Output Display:** Demonstrates the `print()` function to send messages to the console
3. **Syntax Introduction:** Shows the basic structure of a Python script and the use of comments
4. **Foundation Building:** Serves as a stepping stone for more complex Python projects

---

##  The Code

The project consists of a single file, `hello_world.py`, containing:

```python
# My first Python program
# This program prints "Hello, World!" to the console

print("Hello, World!")
```

**What each line does:**
- Lines 1-2: Comments explaining what the program does (comments start with `#`)
- Line 4: The `print()` function displays the text inside the quotation marks

---

##  Sample Output

When you run this program, you'll see the following output in your terminal or console:

```
Hello, World!
```

That's it! Simple but powerful—you've just told the computer to communicate with you.

##  How to Run the Program

### Prerequisites

Before running this program, ensure you have:
- **Python 3.x** installed ([Download here](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- A code editor like **VS Code** ([Download here](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
- **Git** installed for version control ([Download here](https://git-scm.com/))

### Method 1: Using VS Code (Recommended for Beginners)

1. **Open the file:**
   - Launch VS Code
   - Go to `File > Open File...`
   - Select `hello_world.py`

2. **Install Python Extension:**
   - Click the Extensions icon (four squares) in the left sidebar
   - Search for "Python"
   - Install the extension by Microsoft

3. **Run the code:**
   - With `hello_world.py` open, click the  Play button in the top-right corner
   - View the output in the Terminal panel at the bottom

### Method 2: Using Terminal/Command Prompt

1. **Navigate to the project folder:**
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/project
   ```

2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   python hello_world.py
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   python3 hello_world.py
   ```

## How to Push Code to GitHub Repository

Follow these steps to upload your code to GitHub:

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the **+** icon (top-right) and select **New repository**
3. Enter repository name: `hello-python`
4. Add a description (optional)
5. Choose **Public** or **Private**
6. Click **Create repository**

### Step 2: Initialize Git in Your Project Folder

Open Terminal/Command Prompt and navigate to your project folder:

```bash
cd path/to/your/project
```

Initialize Git:

```bash
git init
```

### Step 3: Add Your Files

Add all files to the staging area:

```bash
git add .
```

Or add specific files:

```bash
git add hello_world.py
git add README.md
```

### Step 4: Commit Your Changes

Create your first commit:

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit: Add hello world program"
```

### Step 5: Connect to GitHub Repository

Link your local repository to GitHub (replace `Rukyanne` with your username):

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/Rukyanne/hello-python.git
```

### Step 6: Push to GitHub

Push your code to the main branch:

```bash
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 7: Verify Upload

Visit your repository URL to confirm your files are uploaded successfully!

##  What I Learned

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:

-  Using Python's `print()` function for output
-  Writing comments to document code
-  Setting up a development environment with VS Code
-  Creating and managing a GitHub repository
-  Using Git for version control (init, add, commit, push)
-  Writing clear and comprehensive documentation
-  Understanding the basics of Markdown formatting

---

## 🎓 Next Steps

Now that I've mastered the basics, my next learning goals include:

- Variables and data types in Python
- User input with the `input()` function
- Conditional statements (if/else)
- Loops (for and while)
- Functions and code reusability
