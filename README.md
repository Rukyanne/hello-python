Hello World Python Project

Description

This is my first Python project.It is a simple script that demonstrates how to output text to the console. The goal of this project was to learn the basics of Python syntax and how to manage a repository on GitHub.

What This Program Does

This program is a "Hello World" script. Its primary purpose is to:

1. Test the Environment: It confirms that Python is correctly installed and working on your computer.

2. Display Output: It uses the print() command to send a text message from the code to the computer screen.

3. Demonstrate Syntax: It shows how a simple line of Python code is written and how comments are used to explain what the code is doing.

The Code

The project consists of a single file, hello_world.py, which contains the following code:

 This line tells the computer to show the message "Hello, World!" on the screen.
print("Hello, World!")


How to Run the Program

Method 1: Using VS Code (Recommended)

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a great tool for writing code. To run this project:

1. Prerequisite: Make sure you have created the file hello_world.py on your computer (for example, on your Desktop) or downloaded it from your GitHub repository.

2. Open VS Code: Go to File > Open File... and select your hello_world.py file.

3. Install the Python Plugin: Click on the Extensions icon on the left sidebar (it looks like four squares).

4. Search for "Python".

5. Click Install on the one made by Microsoft.

6. Run the Code:

7. With hello_world.py open in the main window, click the Play button (triangle) in the top right corner.

The message will appear in the "Terminal" panel at the bottom of the screen.

Method 2: Using Terminal or Command Prompt

1. Install Python: Make sure you have Python installed from python.org.

2. Open Terminal: Navigate to the folder where you saved the file.

3. Run the command: Type the following and press Enter:

python hello_world.py


What I Learned

During this project, I learned:

1. How to use the print() function in Python.

2. How to add comments to explain my code.

3. How to create a repository and manage files on GitHub.

5. How to set up a coding environment using VS Code and extensions.
